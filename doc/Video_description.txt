This demo demonstrates a Interactive_Segmentation application based on Qualcomm CM2290. The main function is to use the TensorFlow Lite model to achieve dynamic interactive cutting of images. The first choice is to display the motherboard, followed by the source code and simulator developed on the computer, and finally the display connected to CM2290. Now we choose an image, and we can select the car in the image. You can recognize the main body of the car. Let's change the image and choose the car in the image, We still have a relatively complete identification of the car body we have chosen.
