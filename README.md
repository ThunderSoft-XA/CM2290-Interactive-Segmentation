# Language Detector Android Demo

### Overview

This sample will accept text entered into a field and classify it as a detected language with a provided confidence score.

These instructions walk you through building and running the demo on an Android
device.

The model file is downloaded via Gradle scripts when you build and run the
app. You don't need to do any steps to download TFLite models into the project
explicitly.
